# Timeline

## Programming

We would emphasize on the programming part for the next two weeks. We would focus on the following things:

- Avoid collision within the center of the intersection.
- Test the system.
- Write the support program which feeds data into the simulation.
- **Decide which method to use to present the program: outside file input or java swing dialog box input?**

## Data

Our progress on data preparation heavily depends on our progress on programming. As a result, we would focus on our actual simulation system first. However, we plan on do the following things at the same time:

- Pick several interesting intersections in NYC DOT.
- Clean the data and produce useful graphs for the paper

## Paper

Although our main focus is programming, we would at the same time put effort into writing our paper. In essence, we would try to work on the following sections:

- Abstract: polish and adjust
- Introduction: draft
- Background: research and draft
- Other sections: vaguely draft until significant progress in other parts
