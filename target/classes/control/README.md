# This is a prototype for the future interface of the traffic model
- There is no need to strictly format this prototype.
- It will eventually be adapted to fit the model and user needs.
- Currently the two adjustable variables are the *amount* of car spawned per hour and the *tickSpeed* of the animaton, which is the number of frames drawn per second.
- These values can be modified in two ways: sliding the *Slider* or typing in the *TextField*.
