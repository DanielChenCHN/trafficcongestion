# AT Comp Sci Project

This project is for the 2019-2020 Advanced Topics in Computer Science course at Tabor Academy. Four students seek to find a method to mitigate traffic congestion.

## Team Members & Roles

- Daniel Chen (programmer & team captain)
- William Wu
    -Programming the Path finding and Obstacle type classes.
    -Creating the graphics and textures for the objects.

## Style guide

- Use the following branch names:
  - *readme-edits* for editing this document
  - *main-structure* for new classes and features
- Always use full spelling when possible
  - *position* instead of *pos*
  - *otherPosition1* and *otherPosition2* instead of *p1* and *p2*
  - *getCarsArray()* instead of *getCarsA()*
- Do not put a space between condition sentences and conditions
  - if(condition) {}
  - while(condition) {}
- Use the four fundamental Classes
  - *Size*
  - *Position*
  - *Velocity*
  - *Acceleration*
- Refer to the magnitude of Velocity as magnitude instead of speed
  - *velocity.getMagnitude()* instead of *velocity.getSpeed()*
- Use same name variables but lowercase for parameters passed
  - *passTime(Time time)* instead of *passTime(Time t)*
  - *Car(Size size, Position position, Velocity velocity)* instead of *Car(Size s, Position p, Velocity v)*
